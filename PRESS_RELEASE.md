## Summary
  Unfortunately the annals of art history is not readily accessible. The metropolitan museum of art is a premier encyclopedic art museum located in New York City's Central Park but not everyone has the resources to visit. That's where @theMet comes in to democratize and allow those unable to access the collection the ability to access it online and save their favorite pieces to come back to.

## Problem
  Allows all an interface to interact with the Met's Art Collection

## Solution
  Creates an easy-to-navigate interface to interact with the collection
