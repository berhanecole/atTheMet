There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

# Project Name
@theMet


## Heading
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Be able to view and save art pieces from the Met!

## Sub-Heading
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  For those who want to experience the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection from the comfort of their phone.

## Summary

  Unfortunately the annals of art history is not readily accessible. The metropolitan museum of art is a premier encyclopedic art museum located in New York City's Central Park but not everyone has the resources to visit. That's where @theMet comes in to democratize and allow those unable to access the collection the ability to access it online and save their favorite pieces to come back to.

## Problem
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Allows all an interface to interact with the Met's Art Collection

## Solution
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Creates an easy-to-navigate interface to interact with the collection

## Quote from You
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "The preservation and democratization of art history is important to us. The aim of @theMet is to integrate one of the largest collections into our network and make it available to all."

## How to Get Started
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Navigate to our homepage and use our search function and find the pieces you'd like to download.
